=======================


When creating a corporate website or service site, it is essential to set up a form for inquiries 
and other purposes.

If you have created a homepage with WordPress, you can easily set up an inquiry form by using the 
plugin "MW WP Form".

What is MW WP FORM?
-------------------------
MW WP Form is a WordPress plugin that allows you to create contact forms and application forms on sites.
You don't need web expertise and you can set up a form by simply copying and pasting a single line of code 
called a shortcode.

It is one of the few plug-ins that can install a confirmation screen, and it also has functions such as 
saving inquiry data, CSV output, data graphing, and validation check. These various settings can be 
completed on one screen, making it an attractive plug-in with a high degree of flexibility and freedom.

Features of MW WP Form
------------------------

In this article, we will explain the functions of "MW WP Form", how to create a form, and the flow 
until the form is submitted. 

How to use MW WP Form
=========================
The features of MW WP Form that most other plugins do not have are as follows.

Confirmation screen

The MW WP Form makes it easy to set up a confirmation screen. A confirmation screen 
is a screen that allows users to review what they have entered in a form before submitting it. 
There are not many plugins that can install a confirmation screen.

MW WP Form can create the same URL or individual URL. In addition to installing
 input screens→ confirmation screens→ completion screens, it is also possible to 
 transition between input screens → completion screens. Another advantage is that you can set the class name, 
 so you can hide specific items on the confirmation screen, such as re-entering your email address.
 
 If you want to easily implement a form with a confirmation screen, we recommend MW WP Form.
 
 
 Data Analytics Capabilities
 ------------------------
 MW WP Form has a data storage feature that allows you to graph aggregated input data.
You can usually check the contents of the form by e-mail to the administrator.
 However, it is difficult to organize and manage them manually.

In MW WP Form, everything submitted from the form is stored in the database. If you have 
multiple forms in your site, it is convenient to store them separately for each form.

When you access the database from the management screen, you can choose between two types of 
graph displays: pie charts and bar charts. Since individual URLs can be assigned to the confirmation 
screen and completion screen, analysis using analysis tools is also possible.


CSV output
--------------
With MW WP Form, you can download the accumulateddata in CS V format.

By analyzing the downloaded data, you can use it to attract customers from the home page and manage customers.

In addition, by having the CSV function, the downloaded data can be linked with various tools such as MA tools and SFA.
